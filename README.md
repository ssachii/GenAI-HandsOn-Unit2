## Unit 2: Generative AI Concepts & LangChain
Welcome to the hands-on materials for Unit 2. This unit covers the foundations of building LLM applications using LangChain, Prompt Engineering, and RAG.

### Notebooks
1. LangChain Foundation
- Why LangChain? Conceptual introduction.
- Setup: Installing libraries and managing API keys securely.
- Models: Temperature settings (Creativity vs. Consistency).
- Prompts & Parsers: Using Templates and LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).

2. Prompt Engineering Basics
- Structure: Role prompting (System/User/AI).
- Few-Shot Learning: Teaching by example.
- Advanced Templates: Partial formatting and reusable components.

3. Advanced Prompting
- Chain of Thought (CoT): Step-by-step reasoning.
- Tree of Thoughts (ToT): Exploratory reasoning (Branching & Judging).
- Graph of Thoughts (GoT): Networked reasoning (Aggregation & Refinement).
- Note: This notebook uses the Groq API (Llama 3) for speed and logic demonstrations.

4. RAG & Vector Stores
- Embeddings: Understanding vector space (with Hugging Face models).
- Vector Stores: Using FAISS for semantic search.
- RAG Pipeline: Building a "Chat with your Data" system.
- Indexing Algorithms: Deep dive into how vector databases scale (HNSW, PQ, IVF).

#### Assignment: Mixture of Experts (MoE): Build a Smart Routing system using Groq that directs queries to specialized Expert prompts.

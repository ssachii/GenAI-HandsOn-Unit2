      "**Troubleshooting IndexError in Python**\n",
      "\n",
      "To solve this issue, we need to identify the cause of the `IndexError`. Here are some general steps to help you diagnose the problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check the index**: Verify that the index being used is within the valid range of the list or array. In Python, indices start at 0, so the last valid index is always one less than the length of the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check for empty lists**: Ensure that the list or array being accessed is not empty, as attempting to access an index on an empty list will raise an `IndexError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Verify list length**: Double-check the length of the list or array to ensure it's what you expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Code Snippet\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume you have the following Python code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "print(my_list[5])  # raises IndexError\n",
      "```\n",
      "In this example, the `IndexError` is raised because the index `5` is out of range for a list of length `3`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Debugging Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inspect the list length**: Use the `len()` function to verify the length of the list:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print(len(my_list))  # Output: 3\n",
      "```\n",
      "2. **Verify the index**: Check the index being used to ensure it's within the valid range:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "index = 5\n",
      "if index >= 0 and index < len(my_list):\n",
      "    print(\"Index is valid\")\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    print(\"Index is out of range\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "3. **Adjust the index or list**: Based on the debugging results, adjust the index or the list as needed to resolve the `IndexError`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Fix\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix the `IndexError`, you can either adjust the index to a valid value or extend the list to accommodate the desired index:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3\n",
      "```\n",
      "Alternatively, you can extend the list to include additional elements:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
      "my_list.append(4)  # add a new element\n",
      "print(my_list[5])  # now valid, output: 4\n",
